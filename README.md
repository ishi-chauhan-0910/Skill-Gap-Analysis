# Skill-Gap-Analysis
This project is designed to assist job seekers in identifying skill gaps by analyzing their resumes against job descriptions. It helps users understand which skills they lack for a particular job role and suggests relevant courses from platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and YouTube to bridge the gap.

Additionally, the system estimates the time required to acquire the necessary skills and become job-ready. To further enhance career preparation, it generates potential interview questions based on the job role and assesses the candidateâ€™s proficiency levels.

One of the key features of this project is the AI-powered mock interview, which provides feedback in text or voice format, helping users improve their interview performance. The goal is to make job search and skill development more efficient and tailored to individual needs.
